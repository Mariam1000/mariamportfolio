### 1- Genetic Variation in SARS-CoV2
! [Genetic Variation in SARS-CoV2](/images/Genetic Variation in SARS-CoV2.PNG)

At the end of December 2019, a novel strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has been identified in Wuhan, a central
city in China, and then spread to every corner of the globe. As of October 8, 2022, the total
number of COVID-19 cases had reached over 621 million worldwide, with more than 6.56
million confirmed deaths. has emerged as a global pandemic with significant public health and
socio-economic impacts. Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences change due to mutation and
recombination, surveilling emerging variants and monitoring changes for improving
pandemic management is pivotal. Understanding the genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 across
different geographic regions is essential for tracking viral evolution, identifying potential
virulence factors, and informing public health measures.
* OBJECTIVE
Identifying conserved genes of coronavirus strains in Egypt, by applying different methods
on ten sequences of ten patients, so these identified genes can be used as diagnosis markers.
